本人是个初三学生，自学了一段时间的JavaScript和HTML，心血来潮做了个这么个东西，不定期更新
这个没啥用的小玩意只有4kb大小，但是它可以运行在一切有支持es6标准JS的浏览器上，目前各种bug层出不穷，这是在经过了我一段时间的修改后才发到GitHub上来的，虽然bug还是一堆。。
目前只有中文版的，怕老外也关注（虽然我知道这玩意压根没人看，是个人都能写出来的东西） 所以我会尽快出个英文版来<br>
咱中国人就不做鸡兔同笼的解释了，小学数学题，实在不知道的话自行百度

I'm just a junior_high school student from China, just learn Javascript and HTML language because of interest for period of time, Because of whim I write this little things, It's baisc on the browser which bulid on es6 stantard ( most of browser except of IE can run it perfectlly ) , I will be cotinue to update this program and fix the bug that I have known ( It may need to be wait until I done my entrance exam which held on June 23-26,2023 ). Because of the test edition, there will be ggigantic amount of bug and Compatibility problem here........

Thank you for you reading and concern about this little and bit stupid program, now I just write a Chinese edition, I will make a English edition as soon as possible

If you dont know what is “Chickens and rabbits in the same cage” problem, I will introduce for you(by using translate tools :<br>
Chicken and rabbit in the same cage is one of the famous mathematical problems in ancient China. This interesting question was recorded in the Sun Tzu Sutra about 1,500 years ago. The book is described like this:<br>
  (It's a period of Classical Chinese, here is the translated version:<br>
  There are several chickens and rabbits in the same cage, counting from above, with 35 heads, and counting from below, with 94 feet. Q: How many chickens and rabbits are in the cage?<br>
The essence of this problem is a binary equation. If the teaching method is appropriate, it can give elementary school students an initial understanding of concepts such as unknowns and equations, and exercise their ability to abstract numbers from application problems. Generally, in the fourth to sixth grade of elementary school, it is taught with unary equations and other content
